<span id="about-me"></span>

**Welcome to my homepage!** I am an undergraduate student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), starting from September 2022, majoring in Artificial Intelligence. Now, I'm a member of the SJTU Cross Media Language Intelligence Lab ([X-LANCE](https://x-lance.github.io/)). 

My research interests focus on **Spoken Dialogue Systems**, **Text-to-Speech**, and **AI for Science**.
